## Company Background

**TechMart** is a growing online electronics retailer based in the UK, specialising in laptops, smartphones, tablets, gaming equipment, and tech accessories. They've been operating for 2 years and have seen rapid growth, but their current data management systems are struggling to keep up.

## The Challenge

TechMart's founders started the business using Excel spreadsheets to track everything - customers, products, orders, and inventory. What worked for 50 orders per month no longer works for 500+ orders per month.

## Current Pain Points

### 1. Customer Management Chaos

- Customer details are repeated in every order row
- Same customers appear with different email formats or phone numbers
- No way to easily identify returning customers or calculate customer lifetime value
- Customer service can't quickly find a customer's order history

### 2. Product Information Mess

- Product details copied and pasted repeatedly
- Inconsistent category names (laptop vs Laptop vs laptops)
- No proper inventory tracking
- Pricing updates require changing hundreds of cells

### 3. Order Processing Problems

- Multiple products in single orders create messy, unusable rows
- Returns and refunds handled inconsistently
- No proper order status tracking
- Difficult to generate sales reports or analyse trends

### 4. Business Impact

- **Time wasted**: Simple questions like "Who are our top customers?" take hours to answer
- **Errors**: Duplicate data entry leads to mistakes and customer complaints
- **Growth limited**: Current system can't scale - adding more data makes it worse
- **Decision making**: Management can't get reliable insights to drive business decisions

## What TechMart Needs

A proper database system that can:

- Store customer information once and reference it for all orders
- Maintain accurate product catalogues with consistent categories
- Track individual items within orders properly
- Support business growth and data analysis
- Enable fast, accurate reporting

## Your Mission

As data engineers, you need to design and build a database solution that solves TechMart's problems. You'll start by understanding what tables and relationships are needed, then create a working database that can handle their business requirements efficiently.

## Key Business Questions to Answer

Your database design should make these questions easy to answer:

1. Who are our most valuable customers?
2. Which products are selling best?
3. What's our average order value by region?
4. Which customers haven't ordered in the last 3 months?
5. How much revenue did we generate last month?
6. Which product categories are most popular?

## Success Criteria

- Customer details stored once, referenced many times
- Easy to add new products and categories
- Order tracking that handles multiple items properly
- Fast queries for business reporting
- Scalable design that can grow with the business
